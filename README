  Version: 2.0.20100627

  CHANGELOG:
  
  - 06/27/2010 - Version 2.0
      - FEATURES
          - Added demo page.
          - Added "default" theme style and images.
          - Added the ability to pass content and class names in as a function.
          - Changed the way columns are built via passing them in.  You now pass
            in row and column information into the "table" object, which is then
            divided into the "rows" and "columns" objects.  Each of these are
            also broken down by section (usually "head", "body" and/or "foot").
            This grouping seems to make more sense, logically.
          - Changed the way tabulate initially gathers its data.  It is now
            nested within the "data" object as "source" -- also changed the
            "load" function to "gather_data" as it makes more sense, logically.

      - MISC
          - Semantic changes, mainly for readability and namespacing.
  
  - 06/22/2010 - Version 1.2
      - BUG FIXES
          - Fixed passing in rows and columns as objects (previously resulted in
            an empty dataset as the object would be pushed to an array).
          - Fixed rows and columns event handlers not being called because of
            namespacing (namespacing of event handlers is now user controlled).
          - Fixed column names if columns is passed as an object, fixed column
            name if array is passed (now uses a "one" based index instead of
            "zero").
            
      - FEATURES
          - Added convenience methods for triggering event handlers and error
            handlers ("trigger" and "error", respectfully), useful especially
            when called from outside the class.
          - Added a "filters" parameter to the load function which allows you
            to apply filters to a single request only (does not store these
            filters in class).
  
  - 06/11/2010 - Version 1.0
      - Initial release
